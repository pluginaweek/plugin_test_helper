* Autoload plugin even if the plugin doesn't define an app_root

* A proxy plugin for the plugin being tested is no longer needed in favor of doing selective plugin loading.

* Make sure RAILS_ROOT is in the load path

* Automate setting of the fixtures path

* Load test_help instead of test/unit so that additional libraries are automatically loaded like they are in your application's tests

*0.0.1* (May 31st, 2007)

* Initial release
